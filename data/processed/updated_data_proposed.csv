33,2,34,2,Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion 400ml,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe!

I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried! I use this product every day and it has improved my dry skin condition massively couldn't recommend this product enough I absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up.

At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny.

They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle.but.if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky  if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green."

Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyones taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads.

The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, attractively ""flowery"" aroma to your clothes. All scents will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users).

2495,6,9,0,Cornetto Made with Soy and Gluten Free Ice Cream Cones 4 x 90ml,4,It's no cookies and cream but a welcome yum treat,I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands. The cone is lovely and the ice cream is nice enough to feel you are having a treat. It doesn't have the creamy feeling and texture of ice cream but near enough to eat and enjoy without any reaction! It's a little smaller than the full size cornetto but that's ok to keep the calories down. Would have liked the choc lump at the bottom of the cone. Already ordered my second box.,0,1,1,0,22,It's no cookies and cream but a welcome yum treat I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands.
