28,"Beautifully Moisturising I love this range of body lotions as they aren\u2019t greasy, are easy to apply and soak in quickly and leave my skin feeling super soft and moisturised. Great value for money and the scent is fresh and light, a great go to beauty essential in my bathroom cupboard. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
29,"A miracle in a bottle! Absolutely love this product! I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried! I use this product every day and it has improved my dry skin condition massively couldn't recommend this product enough I absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
30,"Lingering, comforting smell and cleans really well Absolutely love this stuff ... leaves a lovely lingering fragrance that you can smell each time you open a wardrobe or clothes drawer ... gets everything clean really well too Reminds me of when I was a kid and Mum just put me in some freshly laundered clothes ... lovely",0

32,Perfect for cashmere sweaters and silk tops I love that I now wash my cashmere sweaters at home. Saves me a lot of money compared to taking my clothes to the dry-cleaners every week. Very happy with my purchase,0
33,Skin so soft.. highly recommend! So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
34,"As described, quick delivery Happy with item",0
35,"Light as a feather I really like this. The texture is almost like a gel so it's really light and easily absorbed into my skin, leaving it feel soft and fresh, without any of the weight that some thicker creams have.I would buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1

50,"Best Make-up remover product Have used a lot of make-up brands and in the past bought their more expensive make-up remover products, but none have ever removed mascara, eye-shadow, foundation bases etc as gently and as well as Simple Cleansing Lotion. Its consistency is not runny, you have to squeeze the bottle appropriately onto the cotton wool, which is ideal for controlling how much is dispensed. Also great for tidying up eyeliner or mascara errors when applied sparsely on a cotton wool bud. Always keep this now in my bathroom cabinet. Why pay more?",1

90,"Good if you have sensitive skin This is a good deodorant if you have easily irritated skin. It's like Dove soap in that it doesn't seem to irritate or dry out skin. I've used Dove soaps for quite a long time and this is certainly something which they are good for, this seems to be as good as all of them. It's main selling point, beyond being an effective 24 hour deodorant, is that it is not prone to marking your clothes. It certainly seems to work as far as that goes too, though we haven't been able to test on every single colour. Good though. Recommended.",1

119,A good product The cream is very easy to apply and feels extremly cooling. It doesnt dry with any kind of sticky feeling to it. There is very little or no scent to it so the fact the the frangrance is fairly neutral is good. The cream spread and soaks in very easily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
120,"Beautiful product Execellent product, made my skin feel silky smooth and extremely hydrated. Used it for a couple of weeks and my skin felt healthier, more hydrated and overall looked better. Would definitely recommend this product to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
121,"Smooth, clear skin This cream is light, odourless and leaves the skin feeling genuinely smooth, supple and refreshed. I use it as part of my nightly routine - applying it when going to bed after washing and drying my face. It is light enough not to clog the pores or feel sticky on the face, and in the morning my face always feels smooth and replenished. I have also tried using this cream during the daytime and, while it has all the benefits described above, it\u2019s not long-lasting enough in terms of the hydration it gives, meaning you often feel the need to reapply after a few hours. All in all a great overnight moisturiser if you have sensitive skin - it\u2019s unscented and it\u2019s really gentle on sore patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1

128,"A perfect winter drink We all crave things that transport us back to more innocent times. For me Bovril is one of those things, from the gooey unctuousness of the tar black bovril overflowing from the spoon to the ""ding ding ding"" as I stir it in hot water to make it dissolve and the earthy, beefy smell with hints of celery and goodness knows what else. Sometimes you can get alcohol fatigue so Bovril is a great alternative to a nightcap or even mug of tea. I even go so far as to dissolve a pat of butter in it too for extra richness and within an hour I'm pretty much knocked out and sleep soundly until morning, warm and comforted. This pack will last me a long time I am sure, certainly 2 winters.",0

229,Lovely subtle scent Got this to try and wasnt disappointed. Its a little less thick than some other conditioners on the market but this makes it go further and also I notice the tray doesnt get as mucky afterwards. The clothes were soft and had a lovely subtle scent - still using the large bottle so its going a long way!,1

I was in a situation recently where I only has access to a kettle and chose these over mugshots.....big mistake!!,0
301,"Unsuitable bottle - SPILLAGE While I like the product, the bottle is unsuitable. The plastic is very thin, which is a good thing, and this means it almost impossible to pick up the bottle and fill the very small cap without spilling a significant amount, especially when the bottle is still relatively full. Do buy this, but only if you are happy to decant the content into a sturdier bottle.",1
302,Smells Fab! I love lynx products so was happy to buy this to write a review. I am female but I like the scent of mens products and I think the scent stays longer on the skin. Nice consistency too so you don't lose it off your hands and down the plughole!,1

I found the wipes very soft and easy to use the wipes are nothe too wet or rough with just enough product on them to remove stubborn make up and feel gentle at the same time.

If you suffer from dry skin i would give this a go, its super affordable and easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
515,Simple I\u2019ve been using this shower gel a while and I really like it. It is pretty much unscented and leaves me feeling very clean.

518,"Lovely fragrance but.... This product leaves a lovely fragrance to your laundry. However, I hate the absolute arrogance of Unilever/Comfort to design a large, heavy bottle without incorporating a handle!

It also has a lovely fresh smell and contains great ingredients such as chamomile oil. I would definitely recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
524,"Hydrating and Refreshing Love this shower gel, it does exactly what it aims to do! Lathers well and smells divine; left me feeling extremely fresh and hydrated afterwards. You don't need to use a lot either which means it is long lasting and cost effective! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
525,"Does what it says on the tin Great shower wash, even though it had cucumber extracts there wasn't a strong smell of anything which is great. Both my husband and me were happy to use it. I have sensitive skin which it didn't irritate. I would like to see more eco friendly ingredients and a glass bottle or refillable option [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
526,"So natural and subltle! When I got this, I was a little concerned because I detest cucumber, and I'm very wary of it being in products. I shouldn't have worried, because it's really not that strong at all!The gel is clear, the smell is fresh and not overpowering, and I am going to guess that's due to the natural additions, rather than artificial flavourings etc. It lathered up well and the smell it left wasn't lingering. Great stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
527,"Smell natural I love the smell of this shower gel, smell quite natural, not like the other brand that the fragrance is too strong for me. I feel quite refreshing after using this shower gel, my skin trend to be very dry, but this gel seems to be the right balance of cleansing and moisturising. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
528,"Nothing special I\u2019ve been using this for around a week now, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s just a pretty standard shower gel. The smell is quite strange - it smells like cucumber in the bottle, but almost like tea on the skin. It is quite gentle on the skin, but ultimately I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty average.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
534,Skin Purifying! I like Simple as a brand as it does feel very natural and not as chemical as other body washes. This shower gel is really great if you want something less scented and more basic.

535,"Alright It is a very neutral product. It\u2019s cheap but you get what you pay for. The smell is niceish, but very natural. Not more special than any other standard shower gel. The positives that it doesn\u2019t have any artificial perfume, colour or chemicals in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
536,Perfect for sensitive skin! I have very reactive skin because of eczema. I have found this shower gel calming and it does not aggravate my skin. I\u2019m pleased to see that there are fewer ingredients in it than similar products and no added perfume! It literally doesn\u2019t smell of anything. For me this is ideal and I\u2019m happy to have another brand of shower gel that I feel safe to use without risking a flare up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
537,Simply soft skin Amazing product! My skin feels super soft to touch. It foams easily in the hand and smooths on the skin like silk. It has a slight scent to it but it is not overpowering at all. I didn\u2019t need to use a lot of the gel either as a little went a long way. It didn\u2019t irritate my skin 1 single bit which is a massive bonus! I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
538,Gentle on skin! Just as I expected from a simple product! Nice and gentle on my skin and you dont need to use tonnes of it so it lasts as expected. No complaints - nice consistent product and would definitely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
539,"Simple - success yet again Simple great as ever! I have always been a great fan of Simple - I have quite sensitive skin and this is perfect, refreshing but without an overpowering scent.

540,"Good basic shower gel Really gentle and cleansing, not a very strong smell though. Kind on your skin and foams nicely, I had just hoped for more of a scent, bit this would great if you have sensitive or delicate skin. Only a small amount needed too!

541,Great shower gel I ve been using this for over 1 week now and I can say that is a great product. It has a subtle smell and it cleans very well. I would recommend this product.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
544,"A good shower gel for sensitive skin I've bought this shower gel a few times whenever my skin is sensitive or reacting to another product. True to the Simple brand name, it's very neutral and does a great job of not irritating my skin further. If you're looking for something luxurious or highly scented, this isn't the shower gel for that, but it's a good everyday essential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
545,"Good for my skin My skin always feels so dry after I shower. However since I use this product I have seen a real improvement. I like the texture on my skin, it always feels good and refreshing. It has a nice, very light, refreshing scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
546,"Gentle on skin I just love simple products as I know they are not harmful on my skin, I started using facial products and now started using the the shower gel too. It has a great soft smell and leaves my skin feeling really soft too.I would highly recommend their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
547,Fresh smell From the simple range so not full of nasties and kind to my skin. This shower gel is refreshing and has a light cucumber smell. It bubbles up well and left my skin soft not dry. Great for all the family as refreshing not floral or masculine smelling . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
548,A bit too simple for me I thought I would give this shower gel a whirl as always looking to try out new ones. Friend had said it had been good for their skin so thought I would give it a whirl The scent is hardly there at all. It doesn\u2019t last like I expected and as such doesn\u2019t allow me to feel like I\u2019m using anything I prefer when the scent lasts through the day as others do That being said it serves it purpose as a soap but I would not buy it again unless there were many other options not available [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
549,I love this! So I tend to use another soap free brand and I ended up trying this and it\u2019s so great. I suffer from reactions from soaps and dry skin and this is great but also I personally would probably use it on a baby\u2019s skin too. It also is fragrance free. It\u2019s great value for money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
550,"Great! I love that this shower gel has no perfumes and things in it! Especially, as I am due to have a baby doing nd will be in the market for lots of these to avoid any post birth irritation!

I use both sides of the wipe and it remains strong and moist. I usually use micellar water but will continue to use these because they are just so good. No overpowering scent, no perfume or colour. Excellent quality and immediate results. Try them you will not be disappointed. Super soft skin with no residue. Very pleased.",1
559,"Gorgeous shower cream, no SLS! I usually buy organic cosmetics and wanted a natural product without the high price tag. I was delighted to find this! This shower cream is one of the few big brands which does not contain SLS, a harmful skin irritant added as a foaming agent to create a lather. It is silky smooth, thick and creamy, gentle on the skin, and rich enough to moisturise my dry mature skin. It has a gorgeous delicate fragrance and feels far more expensive than it is. Excellent value, especially for a product which contains no Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Parabens.",1
560,"shame about the bottle! The mayonnaise would get 5 stars from me for taste but the container is style over substance. The squeezy bottle is, in itself, a genius idea but thats where it stops. It is too tall for the size of cap making it top heavy and unstable. Every bottle Ive ever put in my fridge has tumbled out. The cap is made of brittle plastic so it shatters as it hits the kitchen floor. Its like Groundhog Day each time it happens! Then, as other reviewers have commented, its impossible to get all the product out of the bottle. Surely this container is crying out for a design overhaul?",1
561,yummy ice cream This ice cream is great. The cookie dough pieces are just the right size and the ice cream itself is so creamy and delicious. The only problem is that once you open the tub it's impossible to stop eating until it's all gone.,1

This cream also has an absolutely gorgeous and refreshing smell of aloe vera, which I could smell all day it's so lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
578,"Decent regular lotion This is a decent everyday lotion with a clean light scent.

592,A balm for dry skin I loved the sweet smell of this body lotion. The cream is thick and it absorbs quickly into the skin. The bottle states that it has a non-greasy formula and I found that to be correct. I applied the lotion in the morning and 10 hours later my skin still felt soft.

595,Easily absorbed and smells great This lightly fragranced lotion dispenses easily from the bottle. I found it spread well across my skin and was absorbed quite quickly. It really seemed to work well on my dryer areas such as knees and elbows so I tried it on my feet also! This was a revelation to me as being quite thin it was absorbed very quickly which meant no need for bed socks nor me slipping all over the place all night and also it moisturised my feet really well. I am really impressed with this versatile lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
596,"Really makes a difference We've been using this for months. It's a lovely product. I have dry skin and using it just twice a week helps to keep it under control.

609,"Lovely gel moisturiser I do like the Simple brand products as I have sensitive skin and I need to be really careful with chemicals. This Simple Face Moisturiser moisturiser is fantastic. It has very little smell. It has a gel like consistency without the stickiness or gloopiness of some other products that are on the market. The moisturiser applies well to the skin and sinks in quickly leaving my skin feeling refreshed and moisturised with no heaviness or stickiness. I had no reaction to this moisturiser at all. I have a combination skin and this moisturiser was ideal as it has no greasiness. After a few hours of wearing I find that my skin feels totally normal, there is no greasiness at all which I sometimes get with creamy moisturisers. Also I found that I could apply makeup easily within a short period of time as the moisturiser sunk into my skin easily. I have light wrinkles and although the moisturiser can not perform miracles it did prevent my skin from drying over the day from the effects of heating or the sun. I think that this is one of the best moisturisers that I have used. It does the job with no side effects.",1

652,Best moisturiser I ever used! I have used mosturier in the past where it caused breakouts but with this moisturiser it does its job. It hydrates my dry skin and there were no breakouts. I highly doubt I'll ever switch to another product again.,1
653,"good product I liked this product, it makes skin so soft and skin smells fresh. It is not greasy and absorbs very quickly, making your skin very soft and comfortable. First i thought it smells a little bit strong, but then i thought no it is ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
654,An all round champion This is one product that I think every household should have in their cabinet. I have patchy skin and this soothes all of them leaving my skin refreshed and non-greasy. I even use it on my face. And it also last forever!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
655,"Lovely scent and does the job I suffer from really dry skin in the winter months and despite putting on layers and layers of my usual moisturizer, I only needed one layer within this lotion to keep me moisturized the whole day. It's texture is not very thick which worried me at first but don't let that fool you as it's ingredients work a treat in keeping moisture locked in. Lovely smell too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
656,Soothing and moisturising This time of year my skin tends to become dry and itchy. Within just a few days of using Vaseline Intensive Care aloe soothe my skin feels so much better. It has a really light finish that easily absorbs into your skin without leaving a sticky feeling. It also smells really pleasant but subtle and is non greasy. It definitely delivers what it claims in terms of calming and healing dry skin. I would highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
657,"Lovely I struggle with finding a moisturiser which lasts all day without me getting mid way through the day and feeling my legs are itchy and dry. I've always been willing to pay a fair bit if I find the right product. This one ticks the box as it's not expensive and is a really great cream, I don't feel the need to reapply. Great find for a moisturers, I will be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
658,"Smells lovely I tried this lotion and firstly couldn't get enough of the smell. It smells so clean and fresh. It's quite a light formula, and absorbs easily. It's lightweight, but moisturisers well. You can get dressed straight away. It would be great on holiday, as it's so light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
659,Skin so soft.. highly recommend! So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1

The lotion just glides on and sinks into the skin with a few rubs and doesn't leave an oily residue! The skin just absorbs the lotion as soon as it's applied and I've noticed a huge difference in my skin since using it, I'll definitely be using this lotion every day from now on!

The cucumber fragrance is really nice and fresh and helps to wake me up after a shower without being too overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
711,"Good moisturiser This has a nice aloe scent and smooths on nicely. It is light and absorbs into the skin which takes some getting used to as I have dry skin so am accustomed to richer moisturers that can tend to leave a residue. This doesn't and actually leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft the whole day. I also liked the fact that I could moisturise quickly without having to spend ages smoothing in or waiting for it to absorb so all in all, a good product.

712,"Great body lotion I really like this, it does seem to moisturise better than other body lotions I have tried, and seems to help the skin stay moisturised for longer.

I have been using Persil silk and wool for years and it is really good. I only looked on Amazon as my supermarket had not had any for 3 weeks in a row, and realised it costs about the same here on Amazon Pantry. I wash my silk, wool and linen items on a silk wash ( on my washing machine that is a setting, but I think it comes to the following...30 degrees C, light action, very low spin cycle - very important not to hard spin wool or silk, ruins the fibres) I hang them up to dry. all of these items are either hand wash only or dry clean only items, and quite honestly I do not have the strength to hand wash or the wish to dry clean.

804,Fabric Softner Read a few post Amazon were selling these 38 washes and sending out larger ones so decided to order. They are small bottles has advertised. Not sure they're worth £2 a bottle shops are selling larger ones for 50p extra. Lovely spell don't use any other fabric softer you only need a little amount.,0

876,a big hit with the family The family loved this! The marshmallow is particularly good in it,1
877,Yummy treat The ice cream was smooth but very indulgent. The marshmallow was mostly in the bottom half of the pot and didn't really add much in terms of flavour or texture. I would buy it again as an occasional treat.,1
878,"Enjoyed by all The whole family really enjoyed this ice cream. It was a really lovely texture with plenty of chocolate fish. It may be a little sweet for some, but we really liked it!",1
879,"Different This ice cream is nice, has different textures within and isnt as chocolatey as it looks, it is a little expensive for what it is but its nice as a treat. My favourite bit was the marshmallow bits within the ice cream.",1
880,"Great taste, great name A lovely ice cream, nice chunks of chocolate and a lovely flavour. Its difficult not to eat the entire tub!",1
881,Didnt work for me I usually buy the Mr Muscle one. Ill go back to doing so.,1
882,"Smells gorgeous Great product, I used this for the first time after a bath and shaving my legs. The lotion wasn't greasy and left my legs smelling and feeling Fab. I can't wait to take this on holiday with me and hydrate my skin after a day in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
883,"Light, non greasy and super moisturising. Winter is really taking its toll on my skin and this moisturiser has been wonderful. It soaks in fast, isn't greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well. It does everything I need to and does it well. It's water based so probably not best for oily skin, but on my normal to dry it's doing great. I'm pretty sensitive too but this hasn't caused any problems. However, it also contains Palm Oil. Now, palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things. But at the moment, it's rarely ethically sourced and that's my only issue with this product. Unilever are a big big player and need to address this issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
884,Leaves skin feeling fresh I have tried this product and was totally impressed with how soft it left my skin. Its refreshing to the touch as well as to smell. I suffer from dry skin and this has made such a difference. I will be using this product all the time from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
885,Soft skin I tried the Simple hydrating cleansing wipes during the evening to remove my makeup and cleanoses the skin. I found the wipes very soft and easy to use the wipes are nothe too wet or rough with just enough product on them to remove stubborn make up and feel gentle at the same time. Ideal for when you need tone take off makeup in a hurry and handy for traveling. I would recommend for anyone that has sensitive or dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
886,Small and too sweet Decidedly smaller than a normal Magnums and the raspberry Newsweek the two layers of chocolate is too sweet and too much quantity.,1
887,Feels nourishing Gentle with a lovely lather. Not so keen on this fragrance but would try others in this range.,1
888,"Good shower gel Many thanks to Ocado for this free trial product, which I got my husband to test out. It is a big bottle which should last quite a long time. Because its a gel rather than a liquid this means it is easier to deal with. The fragrance is quite subtle but is definitely recognisable as cedarwood which is quite popular in mens bathing products.",1
889,A hit I wouldnt normally choose chocolate ice cream and my husband isnt a fan either however he was quite taken with this and I think the tub will disappear quickly!,1
890,"Lovely ice cream with plenty of chocolate fish I received a tub of this to try. We had it for dessert after Sunday lunch and one tub was sufficient for all 4 of us. The children both loved it of course (and gave it a million stars out of 5) and particularly enjoyed counting how many chocolate fish they found. I thought it was a really nice chocolate ice cream with plenty of chocolate fish - much more than I expected - but didnt really think there was a lot of caramel or marshmallow content, which was a shame. I would, however, buy this product again.",1
891,"Mmmm If you want a sweet rich chocolate ice cream, this will hit the spot.",1
892,"Not impressed Bought these thinking they were the ordinary simple cleansing wipes as the packaging is the same. Even as exfoliating wipes, do not find them good. They are quite dry (the actual wipes are dry - i don't mean they leave my skin dry!) Not a good product.",1
893,"Preserves the integrity of my skin I have MS and my skin can get burnt fron bladder weakness, using the oil gel keeps my skin protected better than any other product plus it smells nice.",1
894,"Shower Gel Very good product, excellent for every day use.",1
895,"Good Quality Shower Gel This shower gel smells very nice and is quite thick, not runny like some other gels. I would definitely buy this again.",1
896,"Recycled Plastic Great product, very concentrated and good lingering fragrance. The bonus is the bottle is made from 100 percent recycled plastic.",1
897,"Delicious Fun Chocolate Ice Cream All the family love it! Great chocolate ice cream and the kids enjoyed finding the fish! Won't last long in this household, a wonderful treat.",1
898,Yum! Everyone loved this. Will buy again.,1
899,"Formula change :( I've been using this moisturiser daily for 5+ years and it's always been great for the price. However a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply, and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes. I've compared the ingredients from before and think it's possibly due to the inclusion of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Dissapoiting as was always super reliable before, even for my picky skin. Hopefully they'll change the formula back otherwise I won't be buying it again",1
900,Perfect I just try this product and so happy with it. It makes my hair so soft,1
901,"brill Wow i love this so much,the smell is amazing and it lingers on your skin for a while as ive notice with other cream it dont,i love that it is non greasy when applying it too which is another good thing,and i love it because this is the only cream ive found that works and helps with my dry skin that i get in patches on my face,just brill. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
902,"Lovely feel afterwards I would very much recommend this product, after using it my skin feels so soft and smooth. I believe if I continued to use this long term I would see massive benefits. The bottle is huge, so would last you a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
903,"Gentle and moisturising This product is not what I would have bought. Although I like Vaseline products, this one has never appealed to me. The smell is really nice and the product goes onto the skin really well. It soaks in really nicely and doesn't leave a residue like some products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
904,"My hands feel lovely after use This product smells gorgeous. I have used this in the kitchen, and will certainly buy in the future. A great hand wash, lathers well, and non drying to the skin.",1
905,stinging deoderant My husband used this deoderant and found on application was very uncomfortable under arms with a stinging sensation for quite some while after use.,1
906,Didn't work I poured this in kitchen sink drain and left it overnight. Drainage no better in the morning. Then got Essential Waitrose drain unblocker a few days later and it did the job!,1
907,yummy! If you like chocolate icecream then this is a good one! Good texture as well,1
908,No GMO.... YUM Lovely creamy with good chocolate flavour. Contains no GMO,1
909,"Since formula change it can cause scratches I have always used Cif and thought it a great product. However, now the micro granules in it are no long plastic you have to be careful where you use it as it does cause fine scratches - be wary of using on stainless steel.",1
910,chicken stockpots why change what was great - no option for no starts,1
911,Wonderful flavour This is the best stock ever-unless you make your own! Gravy is richer and has a wonderful flavour. Wouldn't be without it.,1
912,Contains Palm Oil Shame they contain palm oil (albeit labelled 'fat'). You would have thought that these would have been reformulated by now given all the publicity.,1
913,chicken stockpots why change what was great - no option for no starts,1
914,Magnum White Ice Cream Bars My husbands favorite - but impossible to find at any of my previous sources. I will check out Target. Thank you.,1
915,"Exactly what I wanted I'm really impressed! This was my first time using self-tan so I was nervous how it would turn out but it worked perfectly - a gradual tan that you can build up, very light texture so it dried quickly and didn't stain or streak. Love it!",1
916,"Subtle, soft and good colour A lovely subtle and soft colour to the skin. I am pale and use medium to dark. Dove scent and no fake tan smell so far. I use for 4-5 days in a row then once or twice weekly. Just Keep rubbing in gently till absorbed.",1
917,"Really good for sensitive skin As a regular user of a number of simple products, I was very impressed with there refreshing shower gel. I suffer with quite dry skin during the winter, and when using other brands of shower gel they can sometimes act harshly and leave my skin quite dry and flaky, especially on my face. However with this simple shower gel this is not the case. It does not irritate my skin in face it leaves my complexion looking clearer and my skin feeling soft. The size of the bottle is adequate for everyday use and regular use. And although the packaging is quite mild it does the job. I would definitely choose this shower gel out of the choice. A little bit goes a long way, and the product has a pleasent scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
918,"A gel that will refresh you ! I love having a shower in the morning and moreover, using a really fresh shower gel. This is the first thing I need to have a great day. With the Simple Refreshing Shower Gel, this is exactly what I was looking for. Something simple and non-odorous. The Refreshing Shower Gel is the perfect blend of ingredients to clean and energise your skin. Perfect for even the most sensitive skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
919,"Great smell and feeling! I got this product a few days ago and used it already many times. While you might think a refreshing shower gel is quite ""liquid"" in its form, you could feel the cucumber extrat, which i found great! Often, products say things on their bottle and don't truly mean it whereas the Simple Product was not one of them. Secondly, the smell is amazing and my skin has not badly acted upon it. I do think it is a good product but it might not please others as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
920,Fresh!!! I love the simple range! It's great for my sensitive skin! Had never tried the shower gel but it's now the only shower gel I will continue to use. Left me feeling fresh and knowing it's best for my skin makes me more likely to recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
921,"Great product! I always use simple products so when I got the notification to request this product I was very pleased. As always, Simple has produced another great product that says what it does on the tin. My skin reacts well to Simple products and I am very pleased with this shower gel.

923,"Good shower This is a really good shower gel for sensitive skin, there isn\u2019t an overwhelming fragrance which a lot other shower gels have and cause irritation without us even realising. The simple shower gel foams well, it\u2019s not drying yet still very refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
924,"Lovely Product Just like the rest of the simple range, this product is really kind to the skin. I have pretty sensitive skin so this is great for me and would defintley recommend to others. Simple design but works well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
925,"Fresh and clean! This Simple shower gel is a clear gel that lathers up really really well, so you don't have to use much to feel clean. As like other Simple products, it doesn't have perfume, so it's pretty much odourless, with a hint of cucumber smell. It feels really natural whilst also making me feel clean, so will definitely be buying again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
926,Very nice I always been a big fan of Simple shower gels they just never disappoint. This one smells really lovely And feels nice and kind to my skin. Perfect for everyday use and would always recommend it to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
927,"Great product Love this shower gel mostly for its simplicity and the fact that it does not contain any nasty chemicals. The scent is simple and smells a bit like soap, it foams nicely on the skin and leaves it soft and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
928,"Kind to Skin This shower gel really is simple to use. A small amount created a lovely thick lather that left my skin feeling incredibly clean, soft and refreshed. There's no perfume - just a clean, fresh smell and no skin irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1

1030,Relief! I recently developed eczema for the first time due to an allergic reaction. I would wake up several times during the night clawing at my arms and legs to stop the itching. While reading labels in the store I saw that this product was accepted by the National Eczema Association and decided to give it a try. By the next day the itching was tolerable. By the fifth day the redness and swelling were all but gone. Still using it every day and my skin feels better each day! Thank You!!!,1

As always Amazon has price fluctuation for many different reasons but this particulr item ranges from £5 to £10. Watch the price!! Can easily buy for £6 in shops when in stock.

1156,"Great for sensitive skin I was cautious at first when using these wipes, I suffer with sensitive skin and often get a stinging feeling if using even sensitive / fragrance free wipes. These were totally different, really moist so no rubbing required and a very light, water-like feeling. Will continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1157,"Refreshing and effective I tried these on a fairly dry swatch of quite concealer on my hand, and it took all but a faint stain off which was quite impressive for a face wipe. On my face they feel refreshing, cool and leave the slightest tingle of 'clean' behind. You can see on the wipe that they're taking off the yuck of the day, along with any makeup (yes, including most of my mascara). I might have put more wipes in the pack- enough for a month of one a day, but that's probably my main niggle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1

1168,That fresh feeling! I wouldn't usually go for a high street product having spent so many years on designer skincare however I was surprised at how clean my skin felt after using the Simple facial wash.

1177,"Seems useful Simple Micellar wipes limited addition (little mix) -The wipes seem alright to use however, not that easy. I've used previous wipes in the past like baby wipes and they seem easier to wipe makeup off. Packaging is beautiful not going to lie. They are useful to get makeup off your hands or your eyes but with foundation just gotta scrub more. Would be nice with a smell, I know they say no artificial perfume but something else would be nice. It states that the wipes dont contain alcohol however, on the back in small writing I see that it says it uses Cetearyl alcohol which is still a form of alcohol. Apart from that, I would use them if I needed too and reccomend the product as an okay product to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1

Really impressed with how easily they lift off makeup and leave skin feeling, it doesn't take a lot to lift the make up off so you don't have to spend hours scrubbing away at it. Would highly recommend, first time I've woken up without small mascara reiments smudge under my eyes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1248,Feel great on skin I have been having a few problems with other makeup wipes recently as I am pregnant and my skin has become more sensitive leaving me with a bright red rash after removing makeup! I have tried a number of different wipes and these are the first I have used that have not left my skin stinging or red! They removed all of my makeup and left my skin feeling great!

1249,Fresh and cleansing Fresh and cleansing make up wipes that leave your skin feeling clean and lightly moisturised! Quicker than a face wash and don2019t feel as harmful to skin as some soap products. Wipes stay fresh in their packet for a long period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1250,"Fantastic toner! I don2019t use alot of toning products as I do not like the cold and the wet immediate feeling on my skin. Also,because my skin is prone to blemishes! But this product really impressed me! The toner is very mild and gentle on my skin as it claims to be. It is very refreshing and gets well absorbed into the skin to clear the remains of any makeup left after cleansing. I do use a night cream and a serum after this but I can honestly say the toner has contributed in a much cleaner finish to my daily regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1251,Now part of my daily routine I tried this out for a week and have absolutely fallen in love with it. Removes the dirt and make up from my face and it doesn't make my skin feel sticky or dry (which many other toners do). I use this every evening as part of my routine now and wont stop now!

1252,"Good for skin This toner is very moisturising, which as someone with dry skin is really beneficial.

1263,"So much use with one wipe! No breakouts! Always apprehensive when buying wipes as I break it so easily. Not only have I not broken out AT ALL in the past 2 weeks of using them, but they also take off all of my makeup, without irritating my skin.

1265,"Lovely and soft I have been using these wipes twice a day for a couple days. I use them to remove my make up every evening and also to freshen up a bit more in the mornings. The wipes are so soft and thick. They left my skin feeling mostirised. Took make up off easily, even water proof mascara. It didn't struggle at all when I had used a make up setting spray. Love these wipes! Would recommend and buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1266,Great product I love the simple range. The texture of the wipe is really pleasing. They take off makeup great. My face feels clean and moisturized after using them.

I love how it makes things smell, lasts for some time and great cleaning power on general stains like tea, deodorant marks, mud, spag bol so great for our family. Really easy to store, use and does. I have often rubbed a little into clothing if there is a particular stain like spag bol in case it needs a little more attention which works wonders even on whites! Really great value and having used it on delicate lingerie cottons, towels, silk dresses, man-made fiber clothing like work clothes, I have no complaints with general washing, highly recommend.",0

1296,"Best Moisturiser yet! Since I have Combination/Oily skin, I have never found the perfect moisturiser - until now. I am quite particular in moisturisers that I don't like it when they leave a greasy feeling on my skin after I've applied it, they take ages to soak in or that they make me break out more. Thankfully, this one doesn't. My skin is more glowy and it definitely feels more hydrated and smooth since I started using this a few months ago. I loved it that much that I repurchased and it will be my go to moisturiser. I've seen many others like this but with a much higher price tag so a good find",1

1362,"Kind cleansing Suffering from mild Ezyema, my skin has always been sensitive and dry so i'm very careful when using skincare products preferring brands who use no nasties. I've been a fan of Simple for a while now, using their moisturisers and face wipes and have just switched to using their Kind to Skin face wash. 3 weeks in and i've noticed my skin is more radiant and less dry than it has been, with my face left feeling clean and fresh after each wash. It's light, refreshing, non perfumed and best of all kind to skin but still cleansing. A great every day mild cleanser that you can introduce to your skin care regime. A great product at a very affordable price range. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1363,Lovely and refreshing I usually like a moisturising face wash as I have fairly dry skin but this is lovely to use after a long day. Leaves no residue and left my skin feeling really soft. I need to be careful not to use too much as a little can go along way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1364,"Gentle and refreshing Having sensitive skin it's usually difficult to find a facial wash that is effective, refreshing, gentle and doesn't dry out my skin. This ticked all those boxes and my skin was left feeling clean and fresh. I will definitely be buying this Simple product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1365,"Good and fresh wash I really like this product, I use it in my double cleansing routine, after using oil to remove my makeup, this product helps removing all the rest. I feel that it really respect my acne prone skin and leaves it fresh and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1366,"Great for every day skin care This product is really surprising! It leaves my face looking and feeling so smooth, soft and fresh! Its a really gentle product and feels amazing when being massaged into wet skin. It rinses off without leaving and any residue and is fantastic value for money! I would certainly recommend this product as part of your every day skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1367,Amazing I use to use shops own brand face wash which seemed to dry my face out and cause spots since trying the simple kind refreshing face wash my face has never felt as soft and no signs of dry skin or spots will definitely be buying this face wash [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1368,Kind and soft on skin I've been using this face wash for just over a week now. I'm really happy with the way it makes my skin feel. It's not drying all and has no harsh chemical smells. It lathers up really well and a little goes a long way. It removes my make up well and leaves my skin nice and soft . Great packaging in a easy squeeze tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1369,"Simple products never let you down I bought this a few months ago due to the fact that I love Simple skincare products and was looking for a drugstore face wash that didn't have lots of nasties. This is the perfect gentle face wash after I take my makeup off, leaved my skin feeling very soft and clean, followed by Simple moisturiser and it's a no brainer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1370,Brilliant after effects This is something I've never tried before and I've now been using it daily and my skin in looking and feeling better. It has a very delicate smell and is easy on the skin and is all goodness I absolutely love this x [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1371,"Great, as always. I really liked this face wash and I would definitely buy it in the future. My skin reacts well to simple products, my face was glowing when I got out of the shower. I would definitely rocemmend to a friend as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1372,"Best face wash This is the best face wash that I have used. It is gentle, fragrance free and it does not dry your skin.",1
1373,average but wouldn't use again I found that a lot of product was needed to remove eye make up. It made my skin feel quite dry around my eyes after using as well.,1
1374,a nice mixture of variety A nice mixture of variety you get two of each flavour but its a bit too creamy compared to other brands..,1
1375,A scrumptious combination of treats These are yummy especially the almond flavoured one as it just melts in your mouth. This is my FAVE! The white chocolate flavoured ice cream is rich and creamy. Its great for white chocolate lovers. All three are scrumptious in their own special way. If you like dark chocolate there is a sweet treat in there for you too. I would 100% recommend!!,1
1376,"Poor Vale For hard water areas, which is most of England, you need to use two capsules in a wash giving only 19 washes in this packet, not the 38 advertised.",1
1377,"MESSY These capsules do a good job but the last two times I've purchased them some have split in the packet. This is inconvenient, messy and wasteful. They are kept in a cool cupboard so they must be getting damaged in transit. Will be using Persil liquid until I read the problem has gone away.",1

1499,"Great for quick on the go make up removing. I carry these in my gym bag for after work when I go. These remove my make up well and don't irritate my face, they remove mascara with some gentle rubbing. The scent isn't too overwhelming and leave my face soft. I wouldn't use these alone as I feel they don't remove everything but they are great for a rush or if you don't have face wash handy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1500,Simple Micellar Wipes I found these wipes to be too dry to effectively remove my makeup. A double cleanse is definitely required with these. Removing eye makeup with these wipes was a struggle. Not as good as other simple wipes I have tried. Quite tough in the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
1501,"Swear by brand Although I love and regularly use a number of simple skincare products I have avoided using facial toner due to a bad experience when using another major brand which left me with extremely dry flaky skin.

I loved that there is really no smell or taste to it. BUT last week, I bought a new jar, put some on, and it has a taste that I can only explain of tasting like black oil that goes into a car. It is terrible! I2019ve tried using it for a week now, and just can2019t stand it any longer. I2019m guessing there2019s been a formula or ingredient supplier change?

It is easily absorbed , doesn't leave greasy skin so is great under make up. Can be used with day or night eye creams. Best of all it's a good price.",1

With the tubs you must use your finger. All the very small tubs and/or lip therapy, etc. come with an added color, flavor or something added besides 100% pure petroleum jelly which irritates my lips.Thank you for reading my concern & hopefully some day there will be \""pure vaseline\"" in a lip balm / tube.

1602,"Great but extortionate price Helped my scalp so much but the price is ridiculous when you consider the amount you have to use per wash and that you must buy the conditioner too. Any other non gentle brand would last me 4 times longer than this. It feels like people with illness are being rinsed (no pun intended). It's a no go for really long hair. I will be looking into other cheaper alternatives but the product is great. It's helped with my husbands dermatitis and with my sore scalp. At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny. It's hard to stop it running down my hair then off down my back so 20% of the bottle just goes down the plug hole without ever washing my hair first.",1

I would have never purchased anything else but my brother said try Persil non bio its great for my nephews sensitive skin. He gave me some of his and I randomly washed clothes and bedding in Persil, as I didnt want my husband to say he had a flare down to the change. He didnt, result for me because I love the fresh smell. I have also noticed and difference in the brightness of my whites and clothes are so soft. I live in a hard water area and the results are great. The capsules are so convenient and perform great with only one, because I am very heavy handed and fill the washing balls up, so I am also saving money with these. I am now a subscriber so dont have to worry about running out :) I do wish they wasnt so attractive on the eye because they do look edible. Please keep out of reach of children because the packaging isnt child proof!!!",0
1640,"Nice and fairly long lasting smell These are quite good, better than I expected. One of them was leaking a bit but nothing to cause concern. The scent is manly and very pleasant. It goes very foamy and the scent lasts quite a bit. I will definitely buy again when I finish them.",0
1641,"Good I was looking for an eye cream not too expensive, I use mostly all the simple skincare as I have dry and sensitive skin, so I bought this eye cream and it's good I have a crease/wrinkle on one of my eyes and when I used this it was very least noticeable! It's moisturizing , light on the eyes also had a soothing effect have bought lots since first try a year ago",1
1642,"Normal to dry skin I'm nearly 26 so I said a year a go I must start using a night cream I have dry and sensitive skin I used the simple purifying cleansing lotion and soothing toner and light moisturiser there all amazing but the night is fantastic its moisturising and when I have spots it clears them up and makes my face look plump and takes my dryness away, It doesn't sting my eyes but the day cream does I think it's because of the SPF. Anyways really love this cream",1
1643,"Better Results After A Few Washes Oddly enough this shampoo now performs much better than it did at the start. Not the most moisturising shampoo out there, my hair at first felt a little dry and stripped. However, not wanting to throw it out before I'd given it a good go, I persevered for a few more washes and now I'm glad I did. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, smooth and manageable and my scalp comfortable. It lathers and cleans well enough for my greasy roots without stripping the drier ends. Gives light moisture to hair without building up. It's grown on me and I now use it everyday!",1

1667,not that good For the first time I bought this ice cream (as the reviews are so good)and try it. To be honest it\u2019s not that bad but not amazing. The vanilla yogurt from alpro is way better. My kids enjoyed but for me need to have more vanilla flavour. My husband smelled and says smell like a big blop of cream.,1
1668,"Love it !!! Always have, always will! Great on toast, in sandwiches with sliced tomatoes & seasoning, as a hot drink or in gravy. Highly recommend.",1
1669,"Capsules do not dissolve Even when washing at 40 or 60deg, I still get remains of capsule in the washer and on clothing. On one occasion it was stuck in the washer's filter and triggered a fault light. Only bought these because I could not get my preferred Persil non-bio tablets any more, and I won't buy any more capsules. Also, the fragrance is overpowering.",1

I'm actually really pale so I find the one for pale skin takes ages to show any colour so I buy this one for darker skin and it gives a lovely colour a bit sooner. You've got to be careful not to treat it like a moisturizer and rub it in well. Be careful on the elbows, wrists, knees and feet like you would with regular tanner. Lasts a long time on the skin and doesn't wear off in patches!",1

1691,"Smell pleasant, wash well I tried these as Im fed up of powder and conditioner leaving a mess in the washing machine drawer and also taking up loads of space in the cupboards. Wed tried another brand however they werent perfumed and the other half likes his laundry to have a fragrance to it - personal preference. So I shopped around to find a cheap but known brand and found these in subscribe and save. Were using them every few days and can say we are quite happy with them. They smell nice but not over powering, leave no residue in the drum or on clothes, come in refill packs so I can top up my container and then the bin isnt full of powder boxes and they are easy to use as theres no question over how much to use. Also as a plus, they dont seem to bleach clothing as I found happened occasionally when using powder that got stuck in clothing and not rinsed out properly. If these stay at a good price then I will continue to buy as Im very happy with them.",0

1800,"Comfort Intense Laundry Conditioner Liquid Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",1

I gave these wipes to my girlfriend who mentioned that they are good for taking make up off or just for morning hydration, and very gentle on the skin if you don't have make up on! My girlfriend is a fan of the simple range and this is one she will be getting again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",1
1807,Delish This is really lovely ice cream. Good price for tub size as well. None of our guests could believe it's vegan.,1

1809,Good hypoallergenic fabric conditioner One of my favorite products and when you get delivered you don't have to carry the hefty thing home. That's a win-win in my books.,0

1814,"Not skin friendly No matter what ingredient they have put in for exfoliation, the tissue is thick and rough and my face was so painful during each wipe and turned all red eventually. It is not a pleasure at all and is not comfortable to use. I should buy one pack in store and try first before order this 6 packs in a box. I personally don't like it. If anyone out there is using this happily can contact me to take away the rest.",0

They make a nice convenient lunch and he likes the flavour. We have gone back to the normal size one's. There is less difference between them than one might imagine and they King is usually much more expensive. These are 90g the King 114 grams.,1

1841,"Excellent product! I suffer from dry skin on various parts of my face, and I have tried many other products, but nothing ever seemed to work. My make-up would sit horribly on my face, it looked blotchy due to the dryness. I found this and decided to give it a go, and it was the best decision I have made. I have only been using it a few weeks, but already there has been great improvement in my skin. My skin feels so refreshed! I would definitely reccommend this product!",1

1843,Yep Smells lovely and fresh,0
1844,"New holy grail! This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have been using it for about three weeks and it has completely transformed my skin. It2019s made it so soft, hydrated and smooth. I used to always struggle with the skin on and around my nose, it was always very dry and extremely dehydrated no matter what I tried and this is the only cream that has completely sorted them issues out. My make up now sits so nicely over my nose and the rest of my skin too. I purchased this sleeping cream and also the day version but I much prefer using this one day and night as the night one is that little bit more moisturising!",1

1851,Okay 4 stars purely because it leaves a smear on my white kitchen tiles but it does clean them well,1

1853,may contain milk??!!! a little confused why so many people are saying these are vegan when the ingredients say these MAY contain milk. May?! what's that about? if the makers of these do not know who does? really disappointing for those who cannot take that risk,1
1854,"Amazing!! I used this in Gran Canaria in 25\u00B0C heat and it protected my face from 8am until 5pm, when i washed it off. It isn't greasy at all and dries with in minutes. Doesn't leave a shiny look and feels like it's moisturising whilst protecting the skin at the same time! I used it every day for 2 weeks and there isn't still loads left in the bottle. Would recommend to anyone!!!! Amazing.",1
1855,"Disappointing new fragrance I've used this product for years and it's always worked well. I recently bought it and it had a new fragrance, which wasn't made obvious and I didn't really like. It doesn't offer me the same sweat protection. Had I known I wouldn't have bought it",1
1856,"Oh God! The smell..... I have no idea how well it tans as yet. I am writing this at 4am, I put it on after my shower yesterday evening and the stink has woken me up and given me an absolutely horrific headache. Desperate to wash it off but I'm afraid of disturbing the kids. Cheers Dove!!",1

1859,"Use a little Lovely smell. Softens clothes. The whole range of Comfort is good. However, I think we all use too much product. The fragrance is strong and the consistency of the conditioner is reasonably thick.I now use half as much as I previously used. One third to half a cap is quite enough for a full wash load to soften and produce amazing scent. And softens clothes admirably. We don't need an overpowering blast of perfume, a subtle whiff is lovely. By using less, we are doing our small bit to save the planet through pollution. We are also saving money as I've noticed that a bottle of softener lasts twice as long. Its a win win!",1

About two weeks after using this my bad cystic acne started to fade by the time i finished the bottle all my acne was gone.i thought i was just missing toner in my skin care so i started using a garnier one i had from a set .One week later my acne comes back so im back to using simple and my acne is fading again.i will never stop using this,1
1892,"Horribly Drying I bought this a couple of months ago along with the cleanser and moisturiser as i have spot prone, oily skin and occasional issues with dermatitis around my eyes. This was the worst mistake ever. I thought I was crazy as Simple is supposed to be gentle on the skin but after using this toner it has dried my skin out and bought the dermatitis back around my eyes so they are very red, the skin flaky and sore in places. At first i didn't think it was the toner but after two months of elimination it is definitely the toner drying out my skin. I would not recommend this product at all.",1

1951,"Great for sensitive skin My wife has extremely sensitive skin, which I never believed until I inadvertently washed some of her clothing in a different detergent. On that basis, she has used either Persil or Fairy products for our joint laundry for many years. Combine that with the fact that we cannot use biological products as we have a septic tank, this product is ideal. The detergent is dispensed into a capsule which is inserted into the main body of the product and then placed on top of the laundry. There is sufficient detergent for 48 washes from the two bottles. The detergent is complimented by a fabric conditioner, which is measured out into the fabric compartment softener on the washing machine; there is sufficient to condition 24 washes. Both products have a pleasant ""clean"" fragrance and leave clothing smelling fresh and soft after drying. A really good product for those with sensitive skin and competitively priced against normal supermarket prices.",1

1964,"Persil and Comfort Sensitive Kit In this ""kit"" for sensitive skin you get x2 Persil non-biological washing detergent (potentially 48 washes) and x1 ultra-concentrate Comfort Pure (potentially 38 washes). I say potentially because if you are doing larger loads you'll need to increase the amount you use. We tend to alternate between Fairy and Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having a reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all the time because some members of the family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on the children's clothes because it leaves them nice and soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by the British Skin Foundation. Price for the kit at the time of writing the review is £11, this is slightly more than you would currently get the individual products in some supermarkets (£3 for each product). But you are getting them delivered too. If you wanted to give a practical baby shower gift, this would be ideal, slightly different to a nappy pyramid. Would also make a practical house-warming present. Overall - good products that work, slightly on the expensive side.",1

1981,Great Product My daughter recommended this to me as she has been using it for last two years and I always commented on her lovely natural tanned legs. Thought I would try this instead of my usual St.Tropez Gradual Tan the one you use in the shower. Well I am so glad I did as it not only gave me natural tan but also had a slight shimmer to it which made my legs look a lot healthier considering I am over 60 and it does not have that awful smell either like other fake tans. I use it once every other day and in between use a body polish to get rid of any dead skin cells and this products seems to work well doing it this way.,1

1996,"Awful streak Bought this as it was on offer, and thiught how different cojld it be from the garnier summer glow? Well aparently this is made to not only go stripey and make your feet orange, but to make you stink of false tan.

2025,Simple Do NOT buy this or any other simple products as they have changed the preservatives in them. I have come out in a bad sore rash my eyes are burning and my top lip tingled I had to wash it all off! I phoned simple and she told me they have had a product change in all their stuff changing the preservatives!! When I asked WHY she just said I don't know it just changed. I want to know why!!?? There's no good reason except maybe for them to save money using cheaper ingredients!! I've used simple products for nearly 20 years since Nivea did the same and sold their company to a German company who changed all their products. Im really angry about this what am I supposed to use now. I have VERY sensitive skin and simple was ok but now it's rubbish! Im skin is sore burnt and simple just don't care!! Please be careful as I usually stock up when my products are on offer but fully Asda gave me a refund onto a gift card as I didn't have the receipt for the 6 bottles I had or I'd have been well out if pocket!!??,1

When I applied it seemed a bit sticky, but just thought it would sink in after a bit of time. When I woke up in the morning the tan hadn't sunk in at all and still felt tacky.

I often use this alongside fake tan to sustain the colour and my skin often gets dry after applying fake tan so this helps to keep it hydrated! It's so quick and easy to apply. You can apply either morning or night and leave on - you'll see results quickly! So good to take away on holiday too to give you that extra summer glow and colour that's so easy to do! However... once you've finished applying, make sure you wash your hands or wipe your palms with a wet wipe. Also clean your nails thoroughly as the colour can stick there as you're using your hands to apply. Other than that, really recommends this product and it's such good value for money!",1

2056,not that good For the first time I bought this ice cream (as the reviews are so good)and try it. To be honest its not that bad but not amazing. The vanilla yogurt from alpro is way better. My kids enjoyed but for me need to have more vanilla flavour. My husband smelled and says smell like a big blop of cream.,1

2059,"Love this! After being caught out by the sudden nice weather and me still being as pale as an uncooked chip I bought a bottle of this to try. The very first time I used it, I did have a couple of streaks on my legs then I read the instructions and realised it says you must apply it in circles, so the next day I used a liberal amount and made sure to use a circular motion all over and I was delighted that on only the second day I had enough colour to go bare-legged (it had also covered up the streaks too)I have now applied this for 4 days running and look like I have been away for a week in the sun. It is a really natural even colour. There is a bit of a whiff of fake tan when you first apply it but it wears off after a few hours. My skins feels so smooth and moisturised too which is an added bonus!",1
2060,"If you're not a fan of tan, you'll be converted! I've always longed for more of a healthy colour to my skin as I am extremely pale, but have been put off each time I have used a tanning product because- well, it's been disastrous. However! This is the first (and only) successful product that i have used which creates a beautifully even, healthy and natural tan within a few days.I could not rate this enough. I also have sensitive, spot-prone skin on my face but I have been able to use this on my face successfully as well. Long-lasting, deeply moisturising and super natural. 10/10 my favourite!",1
2061,Great Ive been using this product for 3 days now. I have a natural tan from this. Easy to apply and i like this better than the bondi sands gradual tan. It does have a slight fake tan smell at first but this wears away. Very pleased,1
2062,Great product I used these everyday for about 3 months and they are great I love simple wipes anyway but these ones are great they remove all your make up and leave your skin feeling refreshed I will definitely buy these [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],1
2063,Best night cream! I put this on every night before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels so hydrated and plumped - I love it! I have sensitive skin and have struggled with eczema throughout my life but this cream has never caused me any problems. I love it.,1
2064,"BEST ! It the perfect and gentle product, focusing on hydration! Not tacky at all , which is also very important to me, goes with every cream :) Highly recommend !!!",1
2065,"Beautiful! My friend told me about dove a few months back and she recommended this particular one. I can see why now though. It makes your skin beautifully soft and it smells devine. Honestly now, I just can't live without it. I always have to buy this scent. It's my signature haha. It's nice to see this is on offer as I wouldn't buy it for nearly £4 I'd go to savers instead and get it as it is normally £1.95. Overall, buy it, smell it, pamper yourself and if you love baths you can get this scent in dove bubble bath too. Hehehe. Enjoy!",1

I have had so many comments on what a nice colour my skin is! So I went back and bought 3 more bottles today! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because as its developing the smell is a bit strong, smells like your cooking Haha, but to get such an amazing result I'm happy with that. Highly recommend",1
2084,Nice results Purchased a week ago have used it about 4 times and after second application I already had a nice subtle tan didn't expect it to work so quick Would say get some disposable gloves as even washing hands straight away did notice odd markings on hands,1
2085,"Summer really revived Bought this not so long ago on special offer but was not expecting much as very rarely lotions give me the desired effect however this one is absolutely perfect. The tan effect is so natural , no blotches or patches. Gorgeous brown colour. 100% recommend.",1
2086,Feels good at first I bought this because I am very fair and hide from sunshine. However this product felt good as a moisturizer however felt clingy and greazy after a few minutes. After 2 hours of waiting the cream remains sticky. Also no change in my skin colour. I am really disappointed. I advise not to buy this product.,1
2087,"Smelly Purchased because it was on offer and my blindingly white legs needed a bit of help. I only wanted a gradual tanner because there is less chance of obvious streaks. It smelt nice on application, a light floral scent. However within a few hours it smelt stronger than actual full on fake tan - very unpleasant. I could also feel the cream sitting on my skin, not fully absorbed or dry. The actual tanning result was barely noticeable. I won't be buying again.",1
2088,"Love it, natural looking bronzed glow Love this! I am fair haired, blue eyed, lily white skin older lady who burns to a crisp in the sun, when i uncover. Having just returned from holiday i wanted to at least look like i had a tan but it was very cold there. I bought this on offer and went for Fair - Med. The first time i put it on my arms all over sparingly i didnt really notice that much although there was definately something. Today i thought let me add a bit more after a my usual morning shower. I applied a bit more liberally over arms legs, and face. I have had comments today on what a lovely glow i have. It has developed nicely today. I have a sassy looking healthy bod and i feel good. Bought another tube and just ordered a few more whilst on offer. I hate sitting in the sun and burning (unless i am covered in P20 lotion) and this is a very safe way to get the bronze look. No streaks, easy to apply, doesnt stain hands, slight tan smell but not too much. I am hooked.",1
2089,"Good but a little sticky Really like the light colour this product gives me-easy to use & streak free. However, reading a lot of reviews many claim the lotion dries quickly however this is not my experience. I spend about an hour drying off and am sticky most of the day.",1

I have been looking for a good face SPF for so long now, especially as the weather has started to improve, but i have always found them to be so expensice - I am so happy this is so inexpensive! I have oily skin and this doesn't make me greasy and it looks amazing under makeup, my makeup looks so much better when I have this on, my foundation goes on so smoothly and my pores are hardly visible! love love love this, really mosituring and good sun protection",1
2095,"The best I started using Cerave's facial lotion a few months ago and since had constant breakouts which isn't the norm for me. Wanting to love the product, I persisted until very recently when I decided enough was enough. I picked up this Simple one and it's the best thing I've done. Within two days not only have my current spots begun to clear, the overall look of my face is so much calmer. Just goes to show that all the fancy, long named, sciencey products don't always come up on top over simple and gentle products like this one.",1

2097,Excellent results for less cost I'm really enjoying using this product because it compares favourably with more expensive brands.,1
2098,"Sceptical at first but love it! I've always used a different brand of gradual ran but the smell has always put me off. As this was half price and I had enough points to use, I thought I would give it a try.1- Smell is lovely2- My skin is so soft3- It goes on so well, just used it like a moisturiser.( washed palms with a wipe!)4- Looks AMAZING!!!5- WILL BE USING IT RATHER THAN MY USUAL ( St.Moritz) 6- Very natural looking.7- I'm quite pale but found 1 application of the medium to dark was perfect!8- It has lasted for quite a few days before I noticed it was starting to disappear quite subtly.9- Great product 10- A must buy!!!!!!!!",1

2106,"Follow the pouring instructions and you are on a winner! Great fragrance that strikes just the right balance - although the wife complains that the small bottles are very difficult to pour accurately from. They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle.but.if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky  if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green.",1
2107,"Economical, softens clothes, not as good as dedicated fragrancers if you want a lasting scent Great price for these bottles, and you only need a small amount (half a cap) in the wash to soften clothes. The smell is nice but doesn't last - if you want something that lingers, try Lenor Unstoppables (but that won't soften clothes). That said, the softening effect is noticeable, even when handwashing delicate underwear. I like the ultra concentration which reduces the size of the bottles for storage.",1
2108,Convenient and effective fabric conditioner This is an ultra concentrated fabric conditioner. I was initially surprised at how small the bottles were but then I read on the side that you only need half a cap of the product so each bottle will last you a while. It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough. I live in an area with very hard water and my clothes came out of the wash feeling soft and smelling lovely. I did really like the scent although it is nothing special (it just had that generic floral fabric conditioner scent that they all have).,1

2117,"Comfort Intense Laundry Conditioner Liquid (Fresh Sky) Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",1
2118,Tasty Lovely,0
2119,"Lovely scent This listing is for a pack of 8, concentrated fabric softeners, although I received a sample for review purposes. Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyones taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads. The bottle looks small, but the liquid is very concentrated, so do use the dosing cap rather than just pour into the machine as you will otherwise use too much (probably).",1

The bottle is small as the liquid is a condensed type and this bottle is capable of 36 washes (apparently), however, I would say that to get a really fragrance you do have to use a little more than it says on the bottle....however, that may be down to my taste to be honest as I do like my laundry to be very fragrant. You put the liquid in the soap/conditioner drawer and measure a small amount out in the lid.",1

2126,"My least favourite Magnum If I was a wild-eyed enthusiast and was asked to rate free Magnums as part of a promotion I'd perhaps err on the generous side. As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums. It's almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick. So, so disappointing when you consider what these could have been.",1

Happy to say that all the claims on the product seem to be true so if you like that traditional Comfort smell buy with confidence.,1

The scent is fresh, floral and pleasant, and not overpowering, and it lingers on washing well afterwards too. The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes. There are 36 washes based on the half capful dose for 4-5kg loads, so as I usually do larger loads I should get approximately 18 washes per bottle.

I've used Comfort on and off for many years and this Fuchsia Passion fragrance is a very nice, light floral fragrance. My towels and clothing all felt nice and soft after being washed and dried, and had a lovely smell of flowers with a hint of fruit  mango?  and freshly laundered clothing.

2168,"Small but Mighty Clearly this latest product variation from Comfort is to address some environmental concerns and plastics waste. The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",1

Fuchsia Passion is delightful, such a lovely scent. As this is ultra concentrated you only need a little amount. I tumble dried most of the clothes and they came out soft and smelling lovely. I often find the tumble dryer makes laundry lose any scent but not on this occasion. I dried some clothes on a clothes horse and was delighted that the whole room took on a lovely scent. I am very impressed that Comfort have concentrated their fabric conditioner and are using recycled plastic in the bottle to cut the amount of plastics used. The whole bottle bar the wrapper is recyclable. The bottle is small (see picture) but as it is ultra concentrated it still lasts as long as a larger bottle. Highly recommended product.",1

This probably explains why there is so much said on the label explaining that a little goes a long way with this product. I have the fuchsia perfume version which smells OK and isn't overpowering. This is a big plus for me as I have had difficulty with the intensely perfumed products in the past.

Ever since I had small babies and now helping with grandchildren, this is the most child-friendly of all the branded washing products. Recommended by the Skin Foundation means you can try any eczema-afflicted skin with this item with confidence. Having the smaller, ultra concentrated Pure Comfort as an extra means you can dish up an extra helping of softness when required. Just a little amount will do the job. Altogether 48 washes from the two handy bottles of Persil's Non-Bio liquid detergent can be carefully measured into the bubble pod, so no waste. In our soft water area, the lesser amount can be used. Yes, it still sorts out everyday stains, no worries there. The scent is fresh and clean, the whole house smells lovely when the laundry is on the go, being aired and ironed.",1

2260,"It's a fabric conditioner not a game changer. The hype attached to the scent of fabric conditioner is something as a family we ignore. All we want is for the clothes to smell fresh and pleasant after a wash, to be soft and comfortable to wear and for the product to be economical. Fortunately, this one fulfills all the criteria. When I say 'to smell fresh and pleasant' I don't mean stink the place out with the scent and overpower and wilt everything in a 100 yard radius. Again, fortunately, this doesn't do so and so gets a general thumbs up, but I could have done without the wording bigging up the wonderfulness of the smells. To me that's an alarm call not to purchase! I'll whisk myself away with my own favourite perfumes. I don't want my clothes having a big-smell life of their own!",1

2262,"Nice, gentle products that don't upset my family's eczema-prone skin These are gentle, skin-kind versions within the Persil and Comfort ranges. The bundled pack is a practical suggestion that offers good value compared to the individual retail prices of 2x25 wash Persil and 1x38 wash Comfort, making the fabric softener effectively free. I can't remember not using Persil non-biological as my laundry detergent of choice, it's the brand I grew up with - one that doesn't irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family. It has a pleasant, but not overly dominant scent, and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes. The Comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle. In real life, the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the Persil, but this doesn't represent poor value (38 washes worth is 38 washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes) and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down.",1

2265,"I'm returning to the Persil non-bio fold. I used Persil non-bio for many years, but changed to a brand specifically for babies about eight years ago, so it was a bit of a homecoming using it again. I really like the flip-top opening and how smoothly the product pours into the dispenser ball, which is much easier than the crosscut design on my usual brand that requires a fair amount of pressure. I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasnt changed; a machine load of baby clothes  together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing. I have decided to go back to using Persil non-bio; not just for the frustration-free dispenser, but it performs so well and is kind to skin. Using it again has made me wonder why I ever left the brand in the first place.",1

Use half a capful of this along with your normal detergent then once dried you have this incredible dreamy scent that really lasts, you can smell it subtly when you open your wardrobe, it's lovely.

Okay, you have to buy a box of it, but, if you have enough storage space, it's the way to go. It has a pleasant scent and it's a good size, though in this house we've been used to bigger bottles. The claim is it has 36 washes per bottle but that's using the recommended 1/2 cap, but I have to admit we've been using slightly more than that. Okay, that own label stuff will be cheaper and does come in a larger size but you do tend to have to use a bit more each wash.",1
2276,Lovely and lasting scent. Bulk buying this Intense version of this seems the only way to get true value for money unless you spot a deal. If you follow the on the bottle instructions the half a cap measure is enough to get the job done properly. The scent is lovely and really seems to last well even after some time after washing. Pleased overall just would probably get standard Comfort as a default and this as an on offer treat. Perhaps even better as the bigger bottles to get more for your money.,1

We personally only use fabric softener and on towels but this certainly did seem to lead them very soft and was a nice fragrance . Value for money this is an excellent product definitely better and cheaper brands some of which just dont work or smell very harsh .,1
2281,Excellent for babies and those with sensitive skin My big baby is 32 but still has really sensitive skin - both his sons also have sensitive skin so I only use Persil non-bio when they are visiting. I have never found a fabric conditioner which has been certified by the British Skin Foundation before but Comfort Pure is - excellent! As the family were due to visit last week I freshly laundered the bedding and it washed well and felt nice and soft. There is a subtle scent which is very pleasant. This set of 3 products is great value at £11. Highly recommend product.,1

2290,"Concentrated Flowers Clearly this latest product variation from Comfort is to address some environmental concerns and plastics waste. The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, attractively ""flowery"" aroma to your clothes. All scents will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",1

Try it on buttered toast, Mucky fat (Pork dripping with the brown jelly) on toast, in a sandwich with cheese, or sliced tomato or sliced boiled egg. Put it on your toast when having beans on toast, or add a couple of teaspoons to a mug of hot water for a tasty drink. Good in a stew or casserole or mixed with butter on a baked potato. It's definitely a love or hate thing....I love it and always take it on holiday if I think it won't be available wherever I'm going.",1

2300,"Soft and Fragrant Comfort has always been my go to brand for fabric softening but I have not come across this fragrance before in the compact range. On opening the bottle, the fragrance is quite strong and I was concerned that it was going to be overpowering on the clothes. But due to the fact that you only need such a small amount, the fragrance is actually quite subtle when the wash is complete. Clothes are lovely and soft and I have ha no reaction to my excema prone skin. Another hit from Comfort",1

I like the product, we have been using it for sometime, gives that extra to a wash, fresh smell, and softer wash Well worth using, only thing I recommend is you have a check at prices etc before buying",1

2317,"Sky fresh... I was a bit worried that a product called 'Intense' might leave an overpowering scent on your laundry, who wants to walk around smelling of fabric conditioner? Thankfully it's not like that at all and the scent it leaves is fresh and quite subtle (once dry) and lingers around without being too pervasive. The Fresh Sky fragrance is appealing and not too chemical-like with a fruity/floral mix. For me, it suits household items more than clothes, things like towels and bed linen are left softened and fresh-smelling. I appreciate the small bottle size and concentrated liquid and that it has less environmental impact but I do think that the concentrated liquids are less effective at softening than the more dilute liquids are. If you're looking for the best softening then consider a full-sized bottle but if you prefer a more subtle softening effect but the same fresh fragrance then this concentrated version is a great buy.",1
2318,Nice shampoo- enough for at least 1 month This is my 3rd time ordering this shampoo. It smells good and the content of the bottle is not too thick or too liquidy it feels like velvet actually. After I use it my hair feels softer which is why I chose this Shampoo for.,0
2319,"Pint-sized softener Currently selling at a price comparable to that of supermarkets, this product is good - the smell is pleasant, and you only need to add a small amount to get your clothes smelling fresh again.",1

2323,"Very concentrated Although the bottle is only 540 ml, the conditioner is very concentrated, so you only use half a capfull at a time - this means you get over 35 washes per bottle. The bottle is made of recycled plastic, and it is in turn recyclable (though not the sleeve), which is a bonus. The fuchsia smell is very pleasant, and clothes end up nice and soft. You are warned to keep the solution away from children and eyes, but this is common sense anyway. Highly recommended.",1

2335,"Doesn't just soften and scent the wash, but the whole house smells fresh and clean! I've not used a separate conditioner in years, because most washing products these days seem to do it all. I hadn't realised how much of a scent boost a separate fabric conditioner delivers, and how much it actually does soften the wash. The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.",1

2337,Smells lovely Great value plenty of washes,0
2338,"Good value This is a more traditional scent from fabric conditioning experts Comfort. This 8 pack is highly concentrated, so you don't need to place much in the conditioner tray for it to be effective. The bottle is made from recycled plastic and itself can be recycled. A nice set of 8 bottles.",1
2339,"Nice fresh smell Comfort Intense has a nice fresh fragrance, although don't use more than recommended as it can be quite strong. The bottle is a nice size, easy for storing in a cupboard and although it looks small, you get a lot of washes out of the bottle. It does leave fabrics softer and is good for using with stuff you wash regularly like towels. Highly recommended!",1
2340,"Brings comfort to your clothes and your soul I love this product. It retains the quality one expects from the well known makers and leaves clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The concept of ultra concentrate isn't new as I recall they did one years ago in a tetra type pack. But now maybe public are ready for this innovation. The container is made from recycled plastic which is fantastic and refillable. It is also recyclable but the sleeve isn't which is a disappointment. I'm hoping the refill packs are from a more cardboard style pack though and fully recyclable. I'm glad it has a dose counter as it seems so much less to use it would be easy to put in too much if it wasn't there. My other half and I have sensitive skin and this was fine for us to use. I found it hard to read the small print on the wrapper even with magnification glass. But I couldn't see anything to say if it was tested on animals or if any animal products used in the making. Although this is not a food product these are issues that are important for many. Whilst it provides details of the headquarter offices it doesn't actually say where its produced, I think this would be helpful to know as for many people myself included would prefer to buy products made in country of sale to reduce carbon footprint. I am a little torn about this product as if it was a washing powder or liquid and comfort softener combination I can't help thinking that cuts down packaging and carbon footprint further and can be better value. However separate comfort softener such as this does make clothes smell lovely.",1

2342,"Good Softener This is a multi-pack of eight bottles of fabric softener. They are not the typical large sized bottles that I am used to, which is a bonus as they are cumbersome and tricky to store. These are half the height and fit better in the storage area in my kitchen. The softener itself has a strong, but not overpowering floral smell. Clothes come out of the wash noticeably softer after use, when compared without any. As I line dry my washing, this has been a nice addition to my laundry routine.",1

2359,"Seems to work well regarding softness, but not much scent. LIKES - Lots of softness. The washed clothing seems remarkably pleasant to touch and feel. - The specified quantity per wash is smaller than some other conditioners, meaning that a smaller bottle gives plenty of washes. LESS LIKED - Seems to have a rather 'light' scent, when used at the advised quantities, so if you like the scent of fabric conditioners you will get less of it. CONCLUSION A decent product, which seems to work well - recommended.",1

2366,Perfect for eczema and sensitive skin We use Persin non-bio washing liquid all the time. It is by far the best washing liquid for sensitive skin. I suffer from eczema and have tried all sorts of sensitive skin washing liquids / powder but Persil is without a doubt the best. Comfort adds a little bit of softens to the whole mix and makes the clothes softer thus easier to wear / removing the little bit of stiffness that can irritate very sensitive skin.,1

2368,"My all time favourite This is THE best night cream I have ever used. I have sensitive dry skin (slightly oily t zone) and this leaves my skin so moisturised and soft. It's very rich so a little goes alobg way, especially on hot summer nights. There's no fragrance and the ingredients are fab for anyone, not just mature skin",1

2371,"Best Scrub I love this scrub, as you actually feel as though you have had a scrub. The beads are actual beads and not like some of the scrubs where you wonder if there are any beads in there? Smell is OK, but in terms of getting rid of dead skin in preparation for your products to sink in and get the full benefit, fantastic. I have been using this scrub for years now and I don't know of any other that comes close. Price is fab. I only have to use this scrub once a week, as it is so good, don't need to do it more than once. I have sensitive skin and have never had a problem. As long as its on the shelf, I'll keep buying it. Best scrub!!",1
2372,Fantastic product. Really works. I have been using this deodourant for 2 months I am no longer sweating. For 5 or 6 years my swearing has been out of control.

2462,"Works well Nice scent, large bottle which seems to be lasting a while based on the smallest dosage recommended. Clothes have a long lasting scent and are noticeably softer then when nothing is used. If the other marketing statements are to be believed, this is a worthwhile purchase.",0
2463,Good price good product Much cheaper than in the shops. This works really well and has a nice scent.,0

2470,"Average Average and not as good as L'oreal but half the price so .. OK but that's all, nothing special like some seem to think ..",0
2471,Very teasonable price I always use this one and the price was great,0
2472,"Best fabric conditioner ever! There might be some more suitable for sensitive skin, but this is the only one that keeps the scent for such a long time. It even beats Lenor intense imho (which is also one of those that keep the scent for weeks!)",0
2473,Ok Ok,0

2483,tasty Taste fine.,1
2484,salty These melted easily into the sauce but was overly salty,1
2485,"Not the best I was disappointed with these. The size seemed small, the 'ice cream' was a funny texture, just melted in the mouth with no substance or flavour. The cone was delicious and crispy, although no chocolate in the bottom like the original cornetto""s. I wont be buying these again, I prefer the new Vegan Magnum.",1
2486,animal testing It would be good to point out that Cif does test on animals. Nope for me.,1
2487,"great substitute Will quite happily buy these instead of the usual Cornettos. The flavour is great, and the ice cream texture is different, but really good. The cone isn't quite as nice as classic Cornetto but still very tasty.",1
2488,Lovely flavour Myself and my grandchildren love these lollies. Unfortunately we all prefer the green ones so these go first. Would be even better if they sold packets with just the lime flavour.,1
2489,A pleasant treat Its been a while since I had the real thing and this is a welcome treat.,1
2490,"Favourite shower gel Love this shower gel, great for sensitive skin, pleasant fragrance and lathers up nicely.",1
2491,"Great cone. AWFUL ice cream Im a Coeliac and intolerant to cows milk, and have a huge sweet tooth. Ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives. Ocado sell a number of delicious ones. I also LOVE Tescos gluten and dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all the amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts and chocolate, and the cone is thick and crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had a flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy and ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from. I enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone, and just cringed my way through the ice cream part. Cant understand all the rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on and delicious!!!",1
2492,"Not as good as the ultra duo Very dissapointed in these capsules. The previous version, which was the Ultra, with only two compartments, was great because the capsules dissolved completely without leaving traces. These leave small white trails on dark clothes.",1
2493,Best make up wipes I find these wipes get my make up off easily and are far superior to other wipes for that alone,1
2494,"Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil. Highly recommended.",1
2495,It's no cookies and cream but a welcome yum treat I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands. The cone is lovely and the ice cream is nice enough to feel you are having a treat. It doesn't have the creamy feeling and texture of ice cream but near enough to eat and enjoy without any reaction! It's a little smaller than the full size cornetto but that's ok to keep the calories down. Would have liked the choc lump at the bottom of the cone. Already ordered my second box.,1
2496,"perfect These are amazing, just like the original Cornetto but vegan. Im really impressed.",1
2497,delicious Our whole family loves bovril and we use it daily on toast in the morning. My 2 year old loves it and always asks for it.,1
2498,This review is for the squeezy bottle Contents of this bottle is lovely. HOWEVER trying to get it out of the squeezy bottle is a challenge of strength and endurance. I will buy Helmann's light mayo again but NEVER in this bottle because I don't want to risk my bones and tendons breaking trying to get the contents out of the bottle.,1
2499,very nice These taste great and you cannot Cant tell they are vegan,1
2500,"Brilliant Really pleased to have vegan Cornettos at last, they're very close to the dairy version and I'm not gluten intolerant but the cone is great and you wouldn't know it's gluten free so I'm happy!",1
